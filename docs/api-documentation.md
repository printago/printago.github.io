# API Documentation ðŸ’Ž

Build powerful integrations with Printago! Our REST API lets you automate your Bambu Lab print farm operations programmatically. ðŸš€

## What's Possible with Our API
The Printago API is the same one that Printago uses on app.printago.io.  

Connect your systems directly to Printago and:
- List and manage your connected printers
- Upload 3D models and create SKUs
- Submit print jobs to your queue
- Monitor print status and progress
- Access print history and analytics
- Realtime access to printer state and entity change events

## Getting Access

To use the Printago API, you must be on a commercial account (even a free one).

### Creating API Keys

1. Go to `Settings` > `Integrations` > `API Keys`
2. This will open the API Key Portal where you can:
   - Create and manage your API keys
   - View usage statistics
   - Download the up-to-date Swagger JSON specification

### API Usage Guide

The API Key Portal provides everything you need to get started:

**Required Headers**
You must include these headers in your requests for proper authentication:
```
authorization: ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY
x-printago-storeid: YOUR_STORE_ID
```

**Code Examples**
The portal includes code examples in multiple languages (cURL, JavaScript, Python) to help you get started quickly.

**Real-time Data with MQTT**
For real-time printer updates, you can use MQTT over WebSockets:
- **Endpoint**: `wss://realtime.printago.io`
- **Username**: Your store ID
- **Password**: Your API key
- **Client ID**: Must start with `apiclient_` (e.g., `apiclient_YOUR_STORE_ID_UNIQUE_SUFFIX`)

**Swagger Documentation**
The most current API specification is always available via the "Download Swagger JSON" button in the portal.

## Authentication

### Required Headers

You must include these headers in your requests for proper authentication:

```
authorization: ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY
x-printago-storeid: YOUR_STORE_ID
```

### Rate Limits

API access is rate-limited to 600 requests over a 10 minute window, which works out to an average of 1 request per second. If you exceed this, your requests will fail until the time window expires.

Each API response includes 2 headers:
- `x-ratelimit-remaining` - the remaining number of API calls left in your 10 minute window before they reset
- `x-ratelimit-reset` - how many seconds remain before your rate limit window resets

## Examples

Below are some API examples to help get you started.  [View additional examples on GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/nsantorello/9a54fe603fc07e54d72ff668a089296f)

### Python - One-off printing of an STL via API

The JSON files represent 3 requests:
- Just prints the part
- Prints to a specific printer
- Prints to printers with certain label(s)

To get these variables:
- `YOUR_PART_ID` - click on your part in the Parts page and look at the url, it should end in `/parts/YOUR_PART_ID`
  - Example: for URL `https://app.printago.io/parts/c8x2dorgp40blck610w4bgg4` the Part ID is `c8x2dorgp40blck610w4bgg4`
- `YOUR_PRINTER_ID` - click on your printer in the Printers page and look at the url, it should end in `/printers/YOUR_PRINTER_ID`
- `TAG1` and `TAG2` - these are tags (case sensitive) the printer needs to have in order to match a print job to it. They can be anything you want. The tags are pipe-delimited -- this character: `|`
- `PRINT_JOB_NAME` - this is just whatever you want to see it show up as in the print queue, e.g. an order number
