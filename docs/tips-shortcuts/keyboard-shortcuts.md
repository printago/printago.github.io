# Keyboard Shortcuts

Printago provides keyboard shortcuts to help you work more efficiently. This guide covers all available shortcuts and the global search functionality.

## Global Search

The primary keyboard shortcut in Printago is the global search function:

- Press `/` (forward slash) to open the site-wide contextual search overlay
- Press `Esc` to close the search overlay

### Using Global Search

The contextual search provides quick access to:
- Print Queue
- Parts Library
- SKUs
- Printers

### Quick Navigation Tips

1. **Fastest Print Queue Access**
   - Press `/` to open search
   - Press `Enter` immediately (Print Queue is the top result)

2. **Finding Specific Items**
   - Press `/` to open search
   - Begin typing the name of what you're looking for
   - Use arrow keys to highlight the desired result and press `Enter` to navigate directly to that item **-OR-**
   - Click on an item in the list.

Search results update in real-time as you type, helping you quickly find exactly what you need.

## Upcoming Features
