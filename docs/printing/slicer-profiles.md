# Slicer Profiles

Your slicer profiles page displays a comprehensive list of all your user profiles synced from your Bambu Lab account.

## Profile Synchronization

Currently, the only mechanism to get or refresh your slicer profiles is to run the [**Bambu Lab Integration Flow**](../printer-setup/bambu-lab-integration.md). This ensures your Printago account stays synchronized with your Bambu Lab setup.

### Cloud Sync Requirement

Profiles are synced from your Bambu Lab account, so be sure to **"Turn on Cloud Sync"** in either:
- Bambu Studio
- Orca Slicer

Without cloud sync enabled, your profiles won't be available for synchronization.

## Managing Your Profiles

### Searching Profiles
You can search through your profile list to quickly narrow down and find specific profiles.

### Deleting Profiles
Profiles can be deleted directly from the Printago interface. However, note that:
- Deleting profiles from your Bambu account alone **won't** delete them from Printago
- You must delete them from within Printago to remove them from your list

## Future Enhancements

Additional functionality for slicer profile management will be added in future updates.
