# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Printago in minutes. This guide walks you through connecting printers, setting up materials, and your first automated print job.

## Before You Begin

Ensure your Bambu Lab printers are ready for cloud integration:

:::important Prerequisites
1. Complete initial setup of your Bambu Lab printer(s)
2. Pair your printer(s) with your Bambu Cloud account
3. Enable cloud profile syncing in your slicer (Bambu Studio/Orca)
:::

:::tip Profile Syncing
In **Bambu Studio/Orca Slicer**: Go to Preferences > Network > Enable cloud syncing and sync your profiles. Printago will import these profiles when you run the Bambu Integration flow.

</div>

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [printago.io](https://app.printago.io) and create your free account
2. Verify your email address and log in

## Step 2: Connect Your Printers

3. From the Dashboard, click `Add Printers` or navigate to `Printing â†’ Printers`

</div>

4. Enter your Bambu Cloud credentials and complete Bambu's 2-Factor authentication as prompted

<div className="margin-left--sm">
  <img src="/img/screenshot_000322.png" width="600" alt="Enter Bambu Lab Credentials" />
</div>

5. The Bambu Integration flow will guide you through selecting printers to connect and importing your cloud-synced slicing profiles

   :::tip Free Unlimited Printers
   Printago supports unlimited printers regardless of account type. See [Subscription Management](/docs/settings/subscription-management.md) for commercial features.
   :::

</div>

6. Configure each printer's default machine and process profiles and click finish 
(materials are configured separately in Step 3)

<div className="margin-left--md">
  <img src="/img/screenshot_000325.png" width="600" alt="Printer List" />
</div>

:::tip Bulk Configuration
Use `Save to all X printers in this group` to quickly configure multiple identical printers at once.
:::

## Step 3: Set Up Materials
Before creating parts, configure your printer materials for intelligent job matching.

:::info Third-Party Materials
This Quick Start covers importing materials from your AMS. For adding third-party materials, manual entry, or bulk import methods, see [Materials Documentation](../printing/materials.md).
:::


### Import Materials from AMS

7. Navigate to `Printing â†’ Materials`
8. Click `Import from AMS` to automatically detect and add materials currently loaded in your printers

<div className="margin-left--sm">
  <img src="/img/materials/materials_import_from_ams.png" width="600" alt="Import from AMS" />
</div>

### Configure Material Slicing Profiles

9. For each imported material, configure slicing profiles for your printer models and nozzle sizes:
   - Click on any material in your library
   - Set up profiles for each **Printer Model + Nozzle Size** combination
   - Use the auto-complete search (type "PLA" to find PLA profiles quickly)

<div className="margin-left--sm">
  <img src="/img/materials/material_detail.png" width="600" alt="Material Profile Configuration" />
</div>

:::important Profile Requirement
Materials must have slicing profiles configured for each printer model and nozzle size they'll be used with. Missing profiles prevent job matching.
:::

## Step 4: Add Your First Part

10. Go to `Products â†’ Parts` and click `Add Part`

<div className="margin-left--sm">
  <img src="/img/parts/add_parts_1.gif" width="600" alt="Add Part" />
</div>

11. **Upload Your File**: Browse or drag your **STL or 3MF file** into Printago
12. **Configure Part Details**:
    - Enter a name and description for your part
    - Select your slicer (3MF files auto-select the matching version)
    - Choose a process profile override, or leave as "Printer Default"
13. **Material Mapping**: Map each material detected in your file to items in your Material library
14. Click `Create` to upload your part

<div className="margin-left--sm">
  <img src="/img/parts/part_screen.png" width="600" alt="Part Creation Screen" />
</div>

   :::info File Support
   Printago supports STL, STEP, 3MF Projects, OpenSCAD, and GCODE.3MF files. Regular `.gcode` files are not supported.
   :::

## Step 5: Start Your First Print

15. Find the saved part in the parts library and click the `Print` button
   :::tip Quick Link
   After saving the part, a toast notification will give you a quick link to open it up, or you can print the file using [Bulk Actions](/docs/features/bulk-actions.md)
   :::
16. Configure your print:
    - Set quantity
    - Choose printer assignment method:
      - **Next Available**: Automatic matching based on material compatibility
      - **Specific Printer**: Target an individual printer
      - **Tagged Printers**: Target a group of printers
    - Override material selection if desired
17. Click `Print` to add the job to the queue

    :::info Smart Matching
    Printago automatically matches jobs to compatible printers based on material requirements, nozzle size, and availability.
    :::

18. Head to the `Print Queue` to view your job.  

## Step 6: Mark Printers Ready
Finally, for printers to match with jobs Printago must be made aware that the printer bed is clear and that a job may be sent.
19. Navigate to `Printing â†’ Printers` and mark printers as `Clear & Ready`:
    - **Individual**: Click status dropdown â†’ `Clear & Ready`
    - **Bulk**: Select multiple printers â†’ Bulk Actions â†’ `Availability` â†’ `Clear & Ready`

:::tip Safe Bulk Operations
You can safely use "Select All" - actively printing printers will ignore the "Clear and Ready" command.
:::

## Step 7: Watch the Magic Happen

20. **Automatic Processing**: Printago automatically:
    - Matches your job to a compatible printer
    - Slices the part using the [Cloud Slicer](../printing/cloud-slicer.md)
    - Sends the job to the printer and starts printing

21. **Monitor Progress**: Use the `Print Queue` to:
    - Track job progress in the `In Progress` tab
    - Reorder queued jobs by dragging
    - Pause, resume, or cancel jobs using bulk actions

:::tip Queue Processing
Jobs process in top-to-bottom order, automatically matching to compatible printers based on material requirements.
:::

## Step 8: Complete the Workflow

**Important**: When jobs finish, mark printers as `Clear & Ready` to enable the next job!
