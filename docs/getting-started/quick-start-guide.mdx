## Before You Begin

:::important Prerequisites
Before starting with Printago, ensure you have:
1. Completed initial setup of your Bambu Lab printer(s)
2. Paired your printer(s) with your Bambu Cloud account
3. Enabled cloud profile syncing in your slicer
4. Loaded filaments into your printers (AMS or external spools)
:::

### Enable Cloud Profile Sync

Printago's [Cloud Slicer](../printing/cloud-slicer.md) automatically syncs slicing profiles from your Bambu Lab account. When you modify a profile, changes apply to all associated parts. Adding a new printer? No need to re-slice existing models - Printago handles slicing automatically based on your printer and material configurations.

In Orca Slicer or Bambu Studio:
1. Ensure you're logged into the slicer with your Bambu Lab account
2. Open Preferences
3. Navigate to Presets section
4. Enable "Auto sync user presets"

## Step 1: Connect Your Printers

:::tip Bulk Import
Printago imports all your Bambu Lab printers at once - no need to add them individually!
:::
1. Navigate to `Printing → Printers` in the sidebar
2. Click `Configure Bambu Printers`
   <img src="/img/screenshot_000321.png" width="600" alt="Blank Printers Screen" />
3. Enter your Bambu Cloud credentials and complete Bambu's 2-Factor authentication as prompted
   <img src="/img/screenshot_000322.png" width="600" alt="Enter Bambu Lab Credentials" />
4. After authentication, you'll be taken through a short, two-step wizard allowing you to select which 3d printers to pair and profiles to import

   :::tip Free Unlimited Printers
   Printago allows you to connect and use unlimited printers - free!  
   :::

   <img src="/img/screenshot_000324.png" width="600" alt="Slicing Profiles" />

## Step 2: Configure Printer Defaults

5. On the final screen of the Bambu Wizard, configure each printer's default slicing profiles using the familiar dropdown boxes for `Printer`, `Filament`, and `Process`

   <img src="/img/screenshot_000325.png" width="600" alt="Printer List" />
   These settings serve as defaults for the [Cloud Slicer](../printing/cloud-slicer.md) and enable intelligent job matching
   <img src="/img/screenshot_000326.png" width="600" alt="Printer Config" />
   
:::info On-Demand Slicing
Printago slices parts automatically when jobs are assigned to printers, using the printer's configuration and the part's material requirements.
:::

:::tip Bulk Configuration
Use the `Save to all X printers in this group` option to quickly configure multiple identical printers of the same type at once.
:::
## Step 3: Set Up Materials

Before creating parts, configure your printer materials for intelligent job matching.

### Import Materials from AMS

6. Navigate to `Printing → Materials`
7. Click `Import from AMS` to automatically detect and add all materials currently loaded in your printers

![Import from AMS](/img/materials/materials_import_from_ams.png)

:::tip RFID Auto-Detection
Bambu Lab RFID-tagged filaments are automatically detected with correct material and color information!
:::

### Assign Materials to Printers

8. Go back to `Printing → Printers` and click on each printer
9. For each AMS slot or external spool, click to assign materials:
   - **Specific Material + Color**: Exact match (e.g., "Bambu PLA Basic Red")
   - **Generic Type**: Any material of that type (e.g., "Any PLA")
   - **RFID Auto-Detection**: Automatic for RFID-tagged filaments

:::info Material Matching
Printago uses material assignments to automatically route jobs to compatible printers. More specific assignments provide better print consistency.
:::

## Step 4: Create Your First Part

Now create a part that leverages Printago's intelligent material matching.

   :::info File Support
   Printago supports STL, STEP, 3MF, and OpenSCAD part types. 

   ***`.gcode` and `.gcode.3mf` are not supported.***
   :::

10. Go to `Products → Parts`, and click `Add Part`

    <img src="/img/screenshot_000328.png" width="700" alt="Part Screen" />
11. Upload your file and give it a name and description
12. **Configure Material Requirements**:
    - **Material**: Choose specific material, material type, or "Any [Type]" for flexibility
    - **Process Profile**: Override printer's default process settings (optional)

    :::tip Material Strategy
    - Use **specific materials** for consistent results
    - Use **"Any PLA"** for prototyping flexibility
    - Leave unspecified to use any compatible material
    :::

13. Click `Create` and your part will be saved and ready for printing!
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000329.png" width="700" alt="Part Config" />

## Step 5: Start Your First Print

<!-- ![Print Dialog](./img/print-dialog.png) -->

14. After saving your part, you'll be brought back to the parts list. Find your part and click it

    <img src="/img/screenshot_000330.png" width="700" alt="Find Part" />
   
15. From the part detail screen, click the `Print` button in the upper right
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000331.png" width="700" alt="Part" />

16. **Choose Printer Assignment**:
    - **Next Available Printer**: Automatic matching based on material compatibility
    - **Specific Printer**: Manual printer selection
    - **Printer with Specific Tags**: Target a group of printers ([learn more](../printing/advanced-printing/printer-tags))
   
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000332.png" width="450" alt="Part" />

    :::info Smart Matching
    Printago automatically matches parts to compatible printers based on material requirements, nozzle size, and printer availability.
    :::

17. **Override Materials** (optional): Change the material selection if needed, then set quantity and click `Print`
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000350.png" width="400" alt="Print Button" />
   
18. Review the print confirmation and head to the `Print Queue` to monitor your job
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000351.png" width="700" alt="Print Button" />

## Step 6: Mark Printers Ready

19. Your job is now queued, but hasn't started printing yet. Printago ***does not*** take exclusive control of your printers - you must indicate when printers are ready for new jobs. Click on `Printers`

    <img src="/img/screenshot_000352.png" width="700" alt="" />
   
20. When first connected, all printers show `Awaiting clear & ready state`
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000344.png" width="700" alt="Queue View" />

21. Click on a printer you want to use, then click the `Confirm clear & ready` button in the upper right
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000345.png" width="700" alt="Printer Screen" />
    
    :::warning Clear & Ready State
    Printers must be marked "Clear & Ready" before accepting new jobs. This safety feature prevents Printago from interfering with ongoing prints or dirty print beds.
    :::

22. **Bulk Mark Ready**: Select multiple printers using checkboxes, then use Bulk Action dropdown (`XX Printers Selected`) → `Availability` → `Clear & Ready`
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000346.png" width="700" alt="Printers Screen" />

23. Confirm the action and jobs will start assigning to compatible printers instantly! Head back to the `Print Queue`
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000347.png" width="700" alt="Mark Ready" />
    
    :::info Safe Bulk Operations
    You can safely use "Select All" when marking printers ready - any printer currently printing will ignore the "Clear and Ready" command.
    :::

## Step 7: Monitor and Manage Jobs

24. **Automatic Processing**: Printago automatically slices your part using the [Cloud Slicer](../printing/cloud-slicer.md) and initiates printing on the matched printer

     <img src="/img/screenshot_000348.png" width="700" alt="Mark Ready" />

25. **In Progress Management**: From the `In Progress` tab, select jobs using checkboxes. Use Bulk Actions to `Pause`, `Resume`, or `Cancel` selected jobs
    <img src="/img/screenshot_000349.png" width="700" alt="Mark Ready" />

26. **Queue Management**: On the Queued screen, drag jobs to adjust priority order. Use Bulk Actions to cancel jobs or retry failed ones
    <img src="/img/queue.gif" width="700" alt="Mark Ready" />
    
    :::tip Queue Processing
    The Printago Queue processes jobs in top-to-bottom order, automatically matching them to compatible printers based on material requirements.
    :::

## Step 8: Complete the Workflow

**Important**: When print jobs finish, remember to mark the printer as `Clear & Ready` to enable the next job!
