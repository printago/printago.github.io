# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Printago in minutes. This guide walks you through the essential setup and your first print job.

## Before You Begin

:::important Prerequisites
Before starting with Printago, ensure you have:
1. Completed initial setup of your Bambu Lab printer(s)
2. Paired your printer(s) with your Bambu Cloud account
3. Enabled cloud profile syncing in your slicer  
:::

### Enable Cloud Profile Sync


Printago imports and syncs your slicing profiles from your Bambu Lab Account.  Want to change a slicing setting for all your parts? Or add a new printer model to your fleet and don't feel like slicing all your models for that printer?  Printago allows you to assign slicing profiles to ***parts***, all the slicing happens in the background automatically and on-demand!

## Configuring Printer Defaults

5. On the final screen of the Bambu Wizard, printers slicing configuration must be set.  Familiar dropdown boxes will allow you to set a profile for `Printer`, `Filament`, and `Process`.

   <img src="/img/screenshot_000325.png" width="600" alt="Printer List" />
   Printago uses these settings for slicing and material matching.

All printago parts are sliced on-demand as needed based on your printer and part configurations.

:::tip Bulk Configuration
Use the `Save to all X printers in this group` option to quickly configure multiple identical printers of the same time at once.

## Creating Your First Print

For your first print, we suggest an STL file to learn how Printago slices and prints files.

   :::info File Support
   Printago supports STL, STEP, 3MF, and OpenSCAD part types. 

   ***`.gcode` and `.gcode.3mf` are not supported.***
   :::

6. Go to Products â†’ Parts, and click `Add Part`

7. Upload your file and give it a name and description.  

   Optionally you can set:
      - `Filament Type` to restrict the part to only printing on printers with certain materials (e.g. PLA, ABS)
      - `Process Profile` to override any printer's process slicer setting, with this

8. Click `Create` and our part will be saved and ready for printing!

   [Printer with Specific Tags](../advanced-features/printer-user-tags) allows you to print to a dynamically defined group of printers.

## Queue Management

<!-- ![Print Queue Overview](./img/print-queue.png) -->

### Basic Operations

- Drag and drop to reorder priority

### Available Actions

1. **Pause Jobs**
   - Temporarily halt selected prints
   - Maintains queue position

2. **Resume Jobs**
   - Continue paused prints
   - Respects queue order

3. **Cancel Jobs**
   - Remove jobs from queue
   - Cannot be undone

:::warning Clear & Ready State
Printers must be marked "Clear & Ready" before they'll accept new jobs. This prevents accidentally starting prints on busy printers.
