# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Printago in minutes. This guide walks you through the essential setup and your first print job.

## Before You Begin

:::important Prerequisites
Before starting with Printago, ensure you have:
1. Completed initial setup of your Bambu Lab printer(s)
2. Paired your printer(s) with your Bambu Cloud account
3. Enabled cloud profile syncing in your slicer  
:::

### Enable Cloud Profile Sync


Printago imports and syncs your slicing profiles from your Bambu Lab Account.  Want to change a slicing setting for all your parts? Or add a new printer model to your fleet and don't feel like slicing all your models for that printer?  Printago allows you to assign slicing profiles to ***parts***, all the slicing happens in the background automatically and on-demand!

2. Navigate to Presets section
3. Enable "Auto sync user presets"

## Configuring Printer Defaults

Next we'll setup our printers configuration for slicing.  Familiar dropdown boxes will allow you to set a profile for `Printer`, `Filament`, and `Process`.

![Slicing Profiles](../../static/img/screenshot_000325.png)
Printago uses these settings for slicing and material matching.
