# Examples

Below are some API examples to help get you started.

## Python

### One-off printing of an STL via API

    The JSON files represent 3 requests:

    Just prints the part
    Prints to a specific printer
    Prints to printers with certain label(s)
    To get these variables:

-   `YOUR_PART_ID` - click on your part in the Parts page and look at the url, it should end in `/parts/YOUR_PART_ID`

    -   Example: for URL `https://app.printago.io/parts/c8x2dorgp40blck610w4bgg4` the Part ID is `c8x2dorgp40blck610w4bgg4`

-   `YOUR_PRINTER_ID` - click on your printer in the Printers page and look at the url, it should end in /printers/YOUR_PRINTER_ID

-   `TAG1` and `TAG2` - these are tags (case sensitive) the printer needs to have in order to match a print job to it. They can be anything you want. The tags are 
pipe-delimited -- this character: `|`

-   `PRINT_JOB_NAME` - this is just whatever you want to see it show up as in the print queue, e.g. an order number
