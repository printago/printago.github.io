# Cloud Slicer
:::warning DRAFT PAGE
:::
Printago's cloud slicer converts your 3D models into printer-ready instructions automatically. By handling slicing in the cloud, we eliminate the need to maintain local slicer configurations across multiple machines.

## Bambu Sync

Printago synchronizes with your Bambu Lab Cloud account to:

- Import your custom printer profiles
- Maintain consistent print settings 
- Update slicer configurations automatically

This ensures your cloud slicing matches your local Bambu Studio settings exactly.
