# Cloud Slicer

Printago's cloud slicer converts your 3D models into printer-ready instructions automatically. By handling slicing in the cloud, we eliminate the need to maintain local slicer configurations across multiple machines.

## Bambu Sync

Printago synchronizes with your Bambu Lab Cloud account to:

- Import your custom printer profiles
- Maintain consistent print settings 
- Keep material presets in sync
- Update slicer configurations automatically

This ensures your cloud slicing matches your local Bambu Studio settings exactly.

## Printer and Part Configuration 

### Printer Settings

- Default print quality profiles
- Material-specific configurations 
- Machine-specific adjustments
- Custom start/end G-code

### Part Overrides

- Quality presets per model
- Support preferences
- Build plate adhesion
- Material requirements

:::tip
Changes to your Bambu Studio profiles will automatically sync to Printago's cloud slicer on your next print job.
