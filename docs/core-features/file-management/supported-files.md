# Supported File Types

Printago supports the most common 3D model file formats used in the industry. Upload your files directly to our cloud platform and let us handle the rest! ðŸš€

:::caution Important
We do not support direct G-code files (.gcode) or G-code embedded 3MF files (.gcode.3mf). These files contain printer-specific instructions that may not be compatible with your setup. Instead, upload your source model files and let Printago handle the slicing!
:::

## STL Files
The industry standard for 3D printing. STL files describe only the surface geometry of three-dimensional objects. Perfect for basic models and most printing needs.

## STEP/STP Files
Professional-grade 3D CAD files that maintain precise geometry and assembly information. Ideal for engineering projects and complex parts.

## 3MF Files
Modern 3D Manufacturing Format files that can include color, materials, and other printing preferences. Note: we support standard 3MF files but not .gcode.3mf files.

## OpenSCAD Files
Parametric design files that generate models through code. Perfect for creating customizable products with Printago. [Learn more about our OpenSCAD integration](./openscad).
