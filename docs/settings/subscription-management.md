## Account Types

Printago has two types of accounts:

**Non-Commercial (Hobbyist/Personal)**
- Free forever with unlimited production slots
- Connect unlimited printers at no charge
- Limited access to commercial features (no SKUs, Orders, or API access)

**Commercial**
- First production slot is free
- Additional slots are $4/month each
- Full access to all Printago features including SKUs, Orders, and API
- Connect unlimited printers at no charge

## Production Slots

Printago's pricing is based on "production slots" - not the number of printers you connect. Production slots control how many simultaneous jobs from your queue Printago will process and monitor at once.

**How It Works:**
Even with 20 printers and 100 queued jobs, if you have 5 production slots, Printago will process 5 jobs simultaneously. When one completes, the next job starts on any available printer with the required materials.

This allows your subscription to scale with your business demands on a month-to-month basis. Annual commitments come with discounts.

## Managing Your Subscription

### Accessing Subscription Settings

1. **From Queue Page:** Click "Manage Job Slots" button on the In-Progress tab
2. **From Settings:** Navigate to `Settings -> Subscription`

Here you'll see your current slot count and plan type.

### Managing Production Slots

Click "Manage Subscription" to open the Stripe portal where you can:
- Add or remove production slots
- Update billing information
- View billing history
- Change payment methods

## Account Type Changes

**Upgrading to Commercial:** Non-commercial users can upgrade their accounts to commercial at any time through the subscription settings.

**Downgrading to Non-Commercial:** Commercial users who need to switch back to non-commercial should contact support for assistance.
