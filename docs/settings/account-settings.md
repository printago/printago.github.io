# Account Settings

Manage your account settings and preferences from the Settings page in Printago.

## Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

**Highly recommended!** Protect your account with a time-based one time password (TOTP) using an authenticator app.

MFA adds an extra layer of security to your Printago account by requiring a second form of verification when logging in. This helps protect your account even if your password is compromised.

### Setting up MFA

1. In Printago, go to `Settings` > `Account`
2. Click `Enable` in the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" tile
3. Download an authenticator app on your phone (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password)
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
5. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app to confirm setup
6. Save your backup codes in a secure location

### Using MFA

Once enabled, you'll need to enter a 6-digit code from your authenticator app each time you log in to Printago.

## Notifications

Deliver printer and print job notifications to Discord or a webhookâ€”and soon email, SMS, and push notifications.

Printago can send real-time notifications about your print farm operations, including job completions, printer errors, and other important events.
