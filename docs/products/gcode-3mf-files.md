# gcode.3MF Files

gcode.3MF files are pre-sliced files from Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer that contain ready-to-print G-code wrapped in a 3MF container. While supported by Printago, they come with important limitations.

## What Are GCode.3MF Files?

GCode.3MF files contain:
- **Pre-sliced G-code** ready for immediate printing
- **Printer-specific settings** baked into the G-code
- **No geometry data** - only print instructions and metadata.

## Limitations and Considerations

:::info "We don't do that here"
Printago supports `.gcode.3MF` files, however, this is **not recommended** as it precludes you from taking advantage of our on-demand automatic slicer.
:::

### Key Limitations

- **Printer-specific**: Tightly bound to the exact printer model they were sliced for
- **No re-slicing**: Cannot take advantage of Printago's intelligent slice-on-demand functionality.

## When gcode.3MF Makes Sense

Despite limitations, gcode.3MF files can be useful for:
- **Missing source models** from old projects.  Gcode is all you have.
- **Highly optimized prints** that require specific G-code tweaks done outside the slicer with external post-processing tools.
- **Beta Slicer Versions** Printago only uses `releases` from Orca and Bambu Studio, so if you're taking advantage of or testing a beta slicing feature.
- **Specific printer testing** scenarios where the intent is to send various gcode commands or generally to send the machine any gcode that **is not** generated by the slicer.

## Adding gcode.3MF Files

1. Navigate to `Products -> Parts`
2. Click `+ Add Part`
3. Upload your .gcode.3mf file
4. Configure part settings:
   - **Name and Description**: Identify your part
   - **Allowed Filaments**: Must match G-code requirements
   - **Target Printer Types**: Specify compatible printers

## Material Remapping

The one flexibility gcode.3MF files retain is **material remapping**:
- Materials can be reassigned to color variants and auto-mapped by Printago - just like other parts.
- Temperatures are *baked* into the gcode.  *Only materials of the same type should be used.*

<div className ="margin-left--lg">
:::warning DONT DO THIS
gcode.3MF put you in control of materials and will allow you to map any materials to each used in the file.  **Unlike other part types** in Printago the correct material profiles and temperatures will not be used for gcode 3MF.

## Migration Path

If you're using 3MF.GCODE files, consider migrating to your direct models with Printago:
- **STL/STEP files** for simple parts with custom process profiles
- **3MF projects** for complex parts with modifiers and settings
- **OpenSCAD files** for parametric or customizable parts

This allows you to concentrate on the versioning of models and slicer profiles without a messy gcode library.

## Common Issues
- **Printer incompatibility**: gcode.3mf parts will not match with incompatible printer models
- **Material conflicts**: Pre-sliced settings mean temperatures, bed types, and speeds are baked in.
