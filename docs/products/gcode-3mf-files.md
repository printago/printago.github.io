# Gcode.3mf Files

gcode.3mf files are pre-sliced files from Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer that contain ready-to-print G-code wrapped in a 3MF container. While Printago supports gcode.3mf, we recommend using other formats for most workflows.

## What Are Gcode.3mf Files?

gcode.3mf files contain:
- **Pre-sliced G-code** - Ready for immediate printing
- **Printer-specific settings** - Baked into the G-code
- **No geometry data** - Only contains print instructions and metadata

### Key Limitations

- **Printer-specific** - Only works with the exact printer model they were sliced for
- **No re-slicing** - Cannot use Printago's slice-on-demand features

## When to Use gcode.3mf Files

Consider gcode.3mf only in these specific cases:
- **Legacy projects** - When original model files are unavailable
- **Custom G-code** - For prints requiring manual G-code modifications
- **Beta slicer features** - When using unreleased slicer versions
- **Printer testing** - For sending custom G-code commands

## Adding gcode.3mf Files

1. Go to `Products -> Parts`
2. Click `+ Add Part`
3. Upload your `.gcode.3mf` file
4. Configure part settings:
   - **Name and Description**: Identify your part
   - **Allowed Filaments**: Must match G-code requirements
   - **Target Printer Types**: Specify compatible printers

## Material Remapping

gcode.3mf files support basic material remapping:
- Reassign color variants within the same material type
- Printago can auto-map similar materials
- Temperature settings remain fixed in the G-code

:::warning Important Note
gcode.3mf files bypass Printago's material management. The system won't enforce correct material profiles or temperatures, so ensure your material choices match the G-code requirements.

## Migration to Better Formats

For better workflow management, consider migrating to:
- **STL/STEP** - For simple parts with custom profiles
- **3MF** - For complex parts with modifiers and settings
- **OpenSCAD** - For parametric or customizable designs

This approach keeps your library clean and takes full advantage of Printago's features.

## Common Issues

- **Printer compatibility** - Only works with specific printer models
- **Material constraints** - Temperature and speed settings are fixed in the G-code
- **No updates** - Cannot benefit from slicer improvements without re-exporting
