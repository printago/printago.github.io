# What is Printago?

Printago (prin-TAH-go, /prɪntˈtɑːgoʊ/) is a cloud-based print farm management platform designed for Bambu Lab printer owners and the broader 3D printing community. It connects your printers to a central dashboard with zero additional hardware, automates job routing, and scales from a single printer to hundreds.

## Core Capabilities

- **Instant Printer Connection** - Connect hundreds of Bambu Lab printers in seconds with no Raspberry Pis, servers, or additional hardware
- **Smart Queue Management (Gutenb3d)** - Automatically route prints to the right printer based on material, color, nozzle, tags, and availability
- **On-Demand Cloud Slicing** - Upload STL/3MF/STEP files once; Printago slices per-printer when a job is dispatched
- **Multi-Material Management** - Map colors and materials to slots, with automatic printer matching based on what's loaded
- **Automated Customization** - Native OpenSCAD support for personalized products with dynamic text, sizing, and modifications
- **E-Commerce Integration** - Process orders from Shopify, Etsy, and more directly into your print queue
- **FabMatic Continuous Printing** - Automated bed clearing and continuous job dispatch for lights-out production

## What Makes Printago Different?

### Zero Hardware Requirements
Unlike traditional print farm software that requires Raspberry Pis or local servers, Printago connects directly to Bambu Lab printers through the cloud. No additional computers, no network configuration headaches.

### Slice Once, Print Anywhere
A single slicing profile like "0.16mm with Ironing" works across your entire fleet - P1, X1, A1 Mini. Change a setting once and it applies to future prints on every printer.

### Built-In Product Customization
Native OpenSCAD rendering means you can offer personalized products (custom text, dimensions, features) without manual CAD work for each order.

### Free for Hobbyists
Connect, monitor, and print to unlimited printers on the free plan. Commercial features (SKUs, integrations, API) are available on paid plans based on concurrent production slots.
