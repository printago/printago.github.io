# Part and SKU Folders

Printago provides folders to help organize your Parts and SKUs. Each section (Parts and SKUs) has its own separate set of folders for better organization.

## Creating and Managing Folders

- **Create new folders**: Click the "New Folder" button from the SKUs or Parts list to open a dialog where you can create a new folder
- **Move items**: Multi-select items and use the "Move to Folder" bulk action to organize your content
- **Nested structure**: Folders can be nested within other folders for organization
- **Folder information**: Each folder displays:
  - Total number of items (including items in subfolders)
  - Number of direct subfolders
  - Thumbnail previews of the first few items

<div className="margin-left--sm">
    <img src="/img/features/folders1.png" alt="typical folders view of parts" />

:::warning
Deleting a folder will permanently delete all items and subfolders within it. This action cannot be undone.

</div>

## Working with Folders

- **Navigate folders**: Click a folder to navigate into it
- **Quick Links**: Click any thumbnail preview to go directly to that Part or SKU

## Adding New Items
- **Default location**: When creating a new Part or SKU, it will be placed in whatever folder you were last viewing
- **Change location**: Click the folder icon to open the folder picker and select a different destination
- **Folder picker**: The same dialog is used for both "Move to Folder" Bulks and choosing folder locations when creating new items
