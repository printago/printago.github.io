## Opening Global Search

There are two ways to open global search:

1. **Keyboard shortcut**: Press **`/`** from anywhere in Printago
2. **Search icon**: Click the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the sidebar (next to the dark mode toggle)

The search input will automatically focus, ready for you to start typing.

You can press `/` from any page except when you're already typing in a text field. This makes search instantly accessible no matter where you are in the application.
