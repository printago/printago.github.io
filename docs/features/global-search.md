## Opening Global Search

There are two ways to open global search:

1. **Keyboard shortcut**: Press **`/`** from anywhere in Printago
2. **Search icon**: Click the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the sidebar (next to the dark mode toggle)

The search input will automatically focus, ready for you to start typing.

You can press `/` from any page except when you're already typing in a text field. This makes search instantly accessible no matter where you are in the application.

## Searching Your Workspace

Start typing to filter results across all your content:

- **Parts** - Your 3D models and design files
- **SKUs** - Product assemblies and configurations
- **Printers** - Your printer fleet
- **Materials** - Material profiles and settings
- **Pages** - Key application pages like "Print Queue"

Results appear instantly as you type, grouped by category.

### Search Tips

- **Partial matching**: You don't need to type the full name—"bench" will find "Benchy"
- **No results?**: Try a different search term or check the spelling
- **Clear quickly**: Click the X button or delete your text to start fresh

## Keyboard Navigation

Global search is designed for speed with full keyboard support:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **`/`** | Open search from anywhere |
| **`↑` `↓`** | Navigate through results |
| **`Enter`** | Go to the selected result |
| **`Esc`** | Close the search modal |

As you navigate with arrow keys, the list automatically scrolls to keep the selected item visible. The selected item is highlighted with a blue accent bar on the left.

You can also click any result to navigate to it, but keyboard navigation is usually faster once you get the hang of it.
